**Analysis of “Titanic 1912” Passengers**

1. Overview of the event and the dataset

The dataset demonstrates information on 891 passengers (not all passengers) in the sinking event of RSM Titanic 1912, as noted in the Data Dictionary beside.
Firstly, I did the data cleaning process to remove all “No data” records, handle other inappropriate values and select the analyzable variables for my analysis.

2. What is the distribution of age in the Titanic passengers vs. the mean age?
This figure shows the mean age of ~30 and the high population of the age range of 15 to 35 (labor age) in the total passengers.
I want to better understand the percentage of age groups and the survival rate of these groups. Therefore, I did a group descriptive as follows:

3. The percent of total passengers vs. the percent of survivors by age groups
The column visualization represents the percentage of age groups’ shares in total Titanic passengers, while the red line graph shows the percentage of survivors divided by these five age groups. Overall, there is no big relative difference between the two percentage indicators. The survival rate of the age group below 15 has slightly higher than its percentage per total people.

4. Whether women were given priority in escaping at that event?

The number of males boarding this ship was much higher than the number of females. Yet, the female survivors doubled the number of male survivors. There must have been a priority for women at this tragic event.

5. The distribution of passengers in terms of ticket class, fare, and port of embarkation
