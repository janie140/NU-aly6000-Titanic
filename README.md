Analysis of “Titanic 1912” Passengers

Overview of the event and the dataset

The dataset demonstrates information on 891 passengers (not all passengers) in the sinking event of RSM Titanic 1912, as noted in the Data Dictionary beside.
Firstly, I did the data cleaning process to remove all “No data” records, handle other inappropriate values and select the analyzable variables for my analysis.
